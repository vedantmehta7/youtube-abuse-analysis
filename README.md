## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gather historical data on video uploads, user reports, and policy violations.
- Collect metadata on videos (title, description, tags, etc.).
- Preprocess text data using NLP techniques (tokenization, stemming, etc.).
- Extract visual features from video frames using computer vision algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze trends in policy violations over time.
- Identify correlations between video metadata and policy violations.
- Visualize the distribution of different types of policy violations.

## Feature Engineering
- Create text-based features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Develop visual features using convolutional neural networks.
- Generate user behavior features (e.g., upload frequency, report history).

## Model Development
- Build a multi-class classification model to predict policy violations.
- Implement ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for improved accuracy.
- Develop a deep learning model combining text and visual features.

## Model Evaluation and Optimization
- Use cross-validation to assess model performance.
- Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Scalability and Performance Optimization
- Implement distributed computing using Apache Spark for large-scale processing.
- Optimize model inference time for real-time policy enforcement.
- Develop a pipeline for continuous model retraining and deployment.

## Incident Response System
- Create an automated alert system for detecting sudden spikes in policy violations.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time monitoring of policy enforcement metrics.
- Implement a root cause analysis framework for rapid incident investigation.

## Reporting and Visualization
- Design interactive dashboards for stakeholders using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- Create automated reports on policy enforcement effectiveness and trends.
- Develop visualizations to communicate insights to non-technical teams.
